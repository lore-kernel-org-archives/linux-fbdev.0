I seem to have missed this one. This is important for omapdrm also.
We've had similar patch in TI's linux for a while, but I have never had
time to start upstreaming it.

Two comments:

The "pixclock polarity" could be explained a bit, as it's not really
about polarity. This was discussed when the display-timings stuff was
worked on, and display-timings.txt explains what the "pixelclk-active"
property means.

So here I think you could maybe have a comment pointing to
display-timings.txt, or perhaps a short comment about what the flag is.
Or if you come up with a great name for the define, that's good too =3D).=


The other comment is not about this patch as such, but similar flags
that OMAP has, and possibly some other platforms too:

1) sync signals driven on rising or falling edge of pixel clock
2) hsync and vsync happen at the same time or hsync happens first,
followed by vsync

Any other platforms have similar features?
