independently of the specific implementation, please keep in mind that
the kernel is distributed under the GPLv2, which may have implications
for a proprietary image embedded in the device tree. That doesn't
necessarily have to be a deal-breaker, but it's probably something that
should be considered carefully.

Best regards,
Ulrich
