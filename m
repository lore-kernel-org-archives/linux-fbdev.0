The current documentation refers to using set_memor_wc() as a
possible hole strategy when you have overlapping ioremap() regions,
that's incorrect as set_memory_*() helpers can only be used on RAM,
not IO memory. This fixes that, and updates the documention to
*strongly* discourage overlapping ioremap() memory uses, but also
documents a possible solution should there really be no other
option.
